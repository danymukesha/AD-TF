~Neuronal and glial transcriptional regulators modulate disease-associated chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer’s brains~

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate cell-specific gene expression programs, yet their role 
in shaping chromatin accessibility during Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression remains poorly defined [1,2]. 
Here, we present an integrative, reproducible pipeline that identifies TFs driving chromatin remodeling 
in AD using publicly available single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and TF motif datasets [3,4]. 

By analyzing data from over 80 postmortem human prefrontal cortex samples, we resolve cell-type-specific 
transcriptional regulators and their corresponding motif accessibility patterns. 
Neuronal chromatin regions in AD brains exhibit selective enrichment of CLEAR motifs targeted by TFEB, 
a master regulator of autophagy [5,6], while microglial peaks show increased accessibility for PU.1 and STAT3, 
implicating neuroimmune activation [7,8]. We further demonstrate that TF expression levels correlate 
with motif accessibility in a cell-type-specific manner, revealing potential regulatory circuits disrupted in AD [9,10]. 
This study provides a resource-efficient, open-source framework for investigating TF-chromatin interactions 
in complex brain disorders and identifies candidate TFs for therapeutic targeting in AD [11,12].

We aim to provide a method for "Cell-Type-Specific Multiomic Inference of Transcription Factor Activity 
and Chromatin Accessibility in AD"

With this repository, we have a complete, executable workflow for identifying transcription factors (TFs) 
that drive chromatin accessibility changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
The pipeline integrates single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and motif analysis to map TF activity
and binding preferences at cell-type resolution [3,4,13].


*Key Features*
- snRNA-seq + ATAC-seq integration: We combine SEA-AD and PsychENCODE datasets for robust cell-type-specific analysis.
- TF motif enrichment: We identify enriched TF binding motifs in AD-specific accessible regions.
- TF activity inference: We use SCENIC and DoRothEA to infer TF regulatory activity from expression data.
- Reproducible workflow: We provide a tiny Snakemake pipeline designed for <8GB RAM machines (e.g., AWS t3.large).
