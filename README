~Neuronal and glial transcriptional regulators modulate disease-associated chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer’s brains~

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate cell-specific gene expression programs, yet their role 
in shaping chromatin accessibility during Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression remains poorly defined. 
Here, we present an integrative, reproducible pipeline that identifies TFs driving chromatin remodeling 
in AD using publicly available single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and TF motif datasets. 

By analyzing data from over 80 postmortem human prefrontal cortex samples, we resolve cell-type-specific 
transcriptional regulators and their corresponding motif accessibility patterns. 
Neuronal chromatin regions in AD brains exhibit selective enrichment of CLEAR motifs targeted by TFEB, 
a master regulator of autophagy, while microglial peaks show increased accessibility for PU.1 and STAT3, 
implicating neuroimmune activation. We further demonstrate that TF expression levels correlate 
with motif accessibility in a cell-type-specific manner, revealing potential regulatory circuits disrupted in AD. 
This study provides a resource-efficient, open-source framework for investigating TF-chromatin interactions 
in complex brain disorders and identifies candidate TFs for therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer's disease.

We aim to provide a method for "Cell-Type-Specific Multiomic Inference of Transcription Factor Activity 
and Chromatin Accessibility in AD"

With this repository, we have a complete, executable workflow for identifying transcription factors (TFs) 
that drive chromatin accessibility changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
The pipeline integrates single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and motif analysis to map TF activity
and binding preferences at cell-type resolution.


*Key Features*
- snRNA-seq + ATAC-seq integration: We combine SEA-AD and PsychENCODE datasets for robust cell-type-specific analysis.
- TF motif enrichment: We identify enriched TF binding motifs in AD-specific accessible regions.
- TF activity inference: We use SCENIC and DoRothEA to infer TF regulatory activity from expression data.
- Reproducible workflow: We provide a tiny Snakemake pipeline designed for <8GB RAM machines (e.g., AWS t3.large).
